An Scala timeuuid library for generating version 1 UUIDs, based on http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txts.

This library is a fork and new home of the now unmaintained Gilt Foundation Classes (`com.gilt.gfc`), now called the [GFC Collective](https://github.com/gfc-collective), maintained by some of the original authors.


## Getting gfc-timeuuid

The latest version is 1.0.0, released on 21/Jan/2020 and cross-built against Scala 2.12.x and 2.13.x.

If you're using SBT, add the following line to your build file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.gfccollective" %% "gfc-timeuuid" % "1.0.0"
```

For Maven and other build tools, you can visit [search.maven.org](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Corg.gfccollective).
(This search will also list other available libraries from the GFC Collective.)
